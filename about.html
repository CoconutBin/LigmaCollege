  <h1 class="font-weight-bold">Who are we?</h1>

  <p> ᲼᲼᲼</p>
  <h1 class="font-weight-bold">What makes us Different?</h1>
  <p></p>
  <P>Ligma College Offers Traditional Schooling, and Experemental Classes called the 'Sugmanutz' Method. </P>
  <p>the 'Sugmanutz' Method is an experimental type of class that educates students with the Experimental ai-based technology from Kanyu Inc.</p>
  <p>the technology adapts to a student's learning pattern, and gives the results to the Department of Sugondez Nutz, which then gives the students the necessary Outside experience that they need to get inspired and innovate.</p>
  <P>Students that have the Scholarship must learn a mix of Traditional and the 'Sugmanutz' Method, while students Paying for Admission get a choice between Entirely Learning with 1 Method, or Mixing Both Together.</P>
  <p>For Students that paid for Tutoring, they'll be taught Traditionally, Unless they pay an added fee for the resources needed </p>
  <p> ᲼᲼᲼</p>
  <h1 class="font-weight-bold">Why is the "Sugmanutz" Method so Expensive?</h1>
  <p>The "Sugmanutz" Method is a New Technology, which is experimental with low Demand, We, at Ligma Coll, are Trying as much as possible to lower the price of the "Sugmanutz" Method, but currently, the cost for licensing the software is the biggest cost right now. </p>


  <p> ᲼᲼᲼</p>
  <h1 class="font-weight-bold" id="autumnfest">What is the Autumn Festival?</h1>
  <p></p>
  <P>The Autumn Festival is a Yearly Event Held at our College, it showcases the skill, inovativeness, and the potential that Students at our College have.</P>
  <p>The Main exhibit that is held here is "the Arts of Autumn". It is an exhibit filled with Modern, Contemporary, and Other forms of Art that represents the Season. This year, with a collaboration with The Coconut Library Group, We've added a sub exhibit called the "Fall" of Literature, which showcases Great Literatures made about the Autumn Season in history.</p>
  <p> ᲼᲼᲼</p>
  <h1 class="font-weight-bold">What else should I look forward to?</h1>
  <p>You should look forward to other exhibits made by our Fellow Students, and Companies looking forward to innovate! If you're intrested in making an exhibit here, Go to our Contact Page and Contact us there.</p>
  <p>You should also expect an array of Colleges and Other Education Centers at our College Venue. This is to show our Students the Wide world of Education you can seek other than Ligma Coll.</p>

  <p> ᲼᲼᲼</p>
  <h1 class="font-weight-bold">Is there anything else I should know?</h1>
  <p>Each Main exhibits are located in seperate areas of the College, so It might be a long walk to go through every main one.</p>
  <br><br>
  <h1 class="font-weight-bold" id = "clg">What is the Coconut Library Group?</h1>

  <br>
  <h2 class="font-weight-bold">Glasses: And their versatility by Waifriend</h2>
  <br>
  <p>Glasses are really versatile. First, you can have glasses-wearing girls take them off and suddenly become beautiful, or have girls wearing glasses flashing those cute grins, or have girls stealing the protagonist's glasses and putting them on like, "Haha, got your glasses!' That's just way too cute!  </p>
 
  <p>Also, boys with glasses! I really like when their glasses have that  suspicious looking gleam, and it's amazing how it can look really cool or just be a joke. I really like how it can fulfill all those abstract needs. Being able to switch up the styles and colors of glasses based on your mood is a lot of fun too!</p>
  
  <p>It's actually so much fun! You have those half rim glasses, or the thick frame glasses, everything! It's like you're enjoying all these kinds of glasses at a buffet.  </p>
 
  <p>I really want Luna to try some on or Marine to try some on to replace her eyepatch. We really need glasses to become a thing in hololive and start selling them for HoloComi. </p>
  <P>Don't. You. Think. We. Really. Need. To. Officially. Give. Everyone. Glasses?</P>
